    <h1>Hi, my name is Quentin.</h1>
    
    <p>
        I am interested in Data Science for business and have experience in anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms and artificial neural networks.

    <p>
        I code in Python and am currently learning C# (I used to write in Java but I couldn't handle it anymore).
